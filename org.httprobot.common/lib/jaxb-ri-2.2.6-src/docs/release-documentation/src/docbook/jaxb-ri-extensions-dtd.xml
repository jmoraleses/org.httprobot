        <title>DTD</title>

        <para>The JAXB RI is shipped with experimental DTD support, which lets
        you compile XML DTDs.</para>

        <para>To compile a DTD <literal>test.dtd</literal>, run the XJC
        binding compiler as follows:</para>

        <informalexample>
            <programlisting language="cli"><![CDATA[$ xjc.sh -dtd test.dtd]]></programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>All the other command-line options of the XJC binding compiler
        can be applied. Similarly, the <command>xjc</command> <link
        xlink:href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">ant</link> task supports
        DTD. The generated code will be no different from what is generated
        from W3C XML Schema. You'll use the same JAXB API to access the
        generated code, and it is portable in the sense that it will run on
        any JAXB 2.0 implementation.</para>

        <section xml:id="section-249814783079567">
            <title>Customization</title>

            <para>The customization syntax for DTD is roughly based on the
            ver.0.21 working draft of the JAXB specification, which is
            available at <link
            xlink:href="http://xml.coverpages.org/jaxb0530spec.pdf">xml.coverpages.org</link>.
