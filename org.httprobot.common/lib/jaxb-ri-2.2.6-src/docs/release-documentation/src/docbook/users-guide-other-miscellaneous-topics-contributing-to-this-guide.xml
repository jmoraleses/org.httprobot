    <para>This document is maintained by people in the community. If you'd
    like to have the edit access to this document, please let us know so that
    we can discuss it.</para>

    <para>The master source of this document is written in <link
    xlink:href="http://fisheye5.cenqua.com/browse/jaxb/unofficial-guide/docs">HTML</link>
    + <link
    xlink:href="http://fisheye5.cenqua.com/browse/jaxb/unofficial-guide/tags">a
    set of custom tags</link>. The use of custom tags allow us to ensure a
    consistent look&amp;feel, and take care of other mandane tasks like
    assigning chapter/section numbers and generating permalinks. The
    technology is based on <link
    xlink:href="http://commons.apache.org/jelly/">Jelly</link>, so more custom
    tags can be added to perform additional processing and the possibility is
    endless.</para>

    <para>Once you have the commit access, you can update the documents and
    run the build script to generate the final HTMLs to verify the result.
    When you feel satisfied, commit the changes. The repository is polled
    every hour, so your change will be eventually picked up and published, but
    you can also force the update by sending an e-mail to
    <email>hudson-jaxb-unofficial-guide at hudson.sfbay.sun.com</email>.</para>

    <para>The general mode of operation is that:</para>

            <para>When you are answering forum questions, ask yourself if the
            content should instead go to the user's guide. You can then post
            the pointer to the document (trigging a posting by e-mail is handy
            in this case.)</para>

            <para>It's OK to have TBDs and TODOs. This is an incremental
