    <section xml:id="ResultSet">
        <title>ResultSet</title>

        <para>JAXB (or any other databinding engine, for that matter) is for
        binding strongly-typed POJO-like objects to XML, such as
        <literal>AddressBook</literal> class, <literal>PurchaseOrder</literal> class, and
        so on, where you have fields and methods that shape a class.</para>

        <para>There are other kinds of classes that are more close to
        reflection. Those classes don't have methods like
        <literal>getAddress</literal>, and instead you'd do
        <code>get("Address")</code>. JDBC ResultSet is one of those classes.
        It's one class that represents million different data structures, be
        it a customer table or a product table. Generally speaking, these
        classes does not allow JAXB to statically determine what the XML
        representation should look like. Instead, you almost always need to
        look at an instance to determine the shape of XML.</para>

        <para>These classes are not really suitable for binding in JAXB. If
        this is the only object that you'd want to write out, then you'd be
        better off using XMLStreamWriter or some such XML infoset writing API.
        There are <link
        xlink:href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ResultSet+XML">a few online
        articles</link> that cover this topic. Also, many modern database
        offers a native ability to export a query into XML, which is supposed
        to work a lot faster than you'd do in Java (and saves your time of
        writing code.)</para>

        <para>If you are using ResultSet as a part of your object tree that
        you want to marshal to JAXB, then you can use
        <literal>XmlJavaTypeAdapter</literal>.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="HashMap">
        <title>HashMap</title>

        <para>JAXB spec defines a special handling for <literal>Map</literal> when
        it's used as a propety of a bean. For example, the following bean
        would produce XMLs like the following:</para>

        <example>
            <title>Bean with Map</title>

            <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[@XmlRootElement
class Foo {
  public HashMap<String,Integer> map;
}]]></programlisting>
        </example>

        <example>
            <title>XML representation</title>

            <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<foo>
  <map>
    <entry>
      <key>a</key>
      <value>1</value>
    </entry>
    <entry>
      <key>b</key>
      <value>2</value>
    </entry>
  </map>
</foo>]]></programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>Unfortunately, as of 2.1, this processing is only defined for
        bean properties and not when you marshal <literal>HashMap</literal> as a
        top-level object (such as a value in <literal>JAXBElement</literal>.) In
        such case, <literal>HashMap</literal> will be treated as a Java bean, and
        when you look at <literal>HashMap</literal> as a bean it defines no
        getter/setter property pair, so the following code would produce the
        following XML:</para>

        <example>
            <title>Bean with Map</title>

            <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[m = new HashMap();
m.put("abc",1);
marshaller.marshal(new JAXBElement(new QName("root"),HashMap.class,m),System.out);]]></programlisting>
        </example>

        <example>
            <title>XML representation</title>

            <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<root />]]></programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>This issue has been recorded as <link
        xlink:href="http://jaxb.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=223">#223</link>
        and the fix needs to happen in later versions of the JAXB spec.</para>

        <para>In the mean time, such top-level objects have to be first
        adapted to a bean that JAXB can process. This has added benefit of
        being able to control XML representation better. The following code
        illustrates how to do this:</para>

        <example>
            <title>Adapting HashMap</title>

            <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class MyHashMapType {
    public List<MyHashMapEntryType> entry = new ArrayList<MyHashMapEntryType>();
    public MyHashMapType(Map<String,Integer> map) {
        for( Map.Entry<String,Integer> e : map.entrySet() )
            entry.add(new MyHashMapEntryType(e));
    }
    public MyHashMapType() {}
}

public class MyHashMapEntryType {
    @XmlAttribute // @XmlElement and @XmlValue are also fine
    public String key;

    @XmlAttribute // @XmlElement and @XmlValue are also fine
    public int value;

    public MyHashMapEntryType() {}
    public MyHashMapEntryType(Map.Entry<String,Integer> e) {
       key = e.getKey();
       value = e.getValue();
    }
}

marshaller.marshal(new JAXBElement(new QName("root"),MyHashMapType.class,new MyHashMapType(m)),System.out);]]></programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>If you have a lot of difference kinds of <literal>Map</literal>, you
        can instead use <literal>Object</literal> as the key and the value type. In
        that way, you'll be able to use maps with different type parameters,
        at the expense of seeing <literal>xsi:type</literal> attribute on the
        instance document.</para>
